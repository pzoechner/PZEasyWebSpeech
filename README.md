# PZEasyWebSpeech

This JS-file makes it really easy to add speech support to your website. As a workaround for Chrome Browser, the speech is stopped after every full stop. To enhance the quality of speech, several (mostly closing) HTML-Tags are converted to full stops - feel free to add your own by modifying the "text" variable.

## Example
An example of what the library does can be found [here](http://fh.zoechner.com/branson/career/overview/).
